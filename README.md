# substack-scraper

I wasn't able to find a working substack scraper so I wrote a script. It's pretty barebones but it works.

1. Get the urls of all posts from the archive using geturls.py
2. Feed a list of urls into scraper.py. It will save them as html files.

It uses Safari but could be easily modified to use a different browser.
